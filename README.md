# Profit Maximization of Home Appliance Store

The company is a small family-owned store of home appliances based in California. The store
has been in operation for several years and has established a loyal customer base. The company specializes in selling high-quality home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, etc.
In order to ensure that the company remains profitable, the store manager wants to identify the optimal number of units of home appliances to order from the supplier. The manager wants to make sure that the company orders only the number of units that will satisfy the demand, so that the store does not have a surplus of inventory that will not sell.
To achieve this goal, the store manager will need to gather data on customer demand for different home appliances based on last yearâ€™s sales, taking into account factors such as seasonal trends and changes in consumer preferences. The manager will also need to analyze the costs of ordering as well as the profit margins for each appliance.


## Problem Statement and Project Overview

The company has data from the previous year's sales that indicates the demand for each category of home appliances such as microwaves, air conditioners, fans, etc. Based on an analysis of last year's sale data, the company is projecting a 20% increase in demand across all categories of home appliances. The company aims to order only enough inventory to meet demand and avoid carrying excess inventory at the end of the year while staying within the warehouse capacity of 3600 sq. ft. The company is willing to increase its budget to $200,000 for this purpose, as last year's total cost for ordering from the supplier was $159,400.

Therefore, the problem statement is how to identify the optimal number of units of home
appliances to order from the supplier, taking into account the available budget, the projected
increase in demand, the warehouse capacity, and the company's objective of maximizing profit.
